# Project Kururugi - Azure Functions Implementation
## Analysis and plotting of the official vaccination statistics data from JKJAV Malaysia

## Features

Plotting of the official CTIF vaccination stastistics into readable interpreted graphs and charts. 
These are the codes required to run in Azure Functions.

## Online Version

The online live version can be found here:

Please note that the live version source code will always be slightly behind a few commits
as I am making changes on the offline version first before deploying to the live version.
